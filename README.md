# Seclusa Lockdown

**Very early development.** This is a first public build, not a finished game.
Decks, combat, balance, and the look are still changing. Expect rough edges,
including the install icons.

Your ship crash-lands on a strange planet. A sealed fortress sits nearby —
fight through its decks, salvage the parts, and get airborne again.

Offline PWA. Data stays on the device; nothing is sent anywhere.

## What it does

- Version 0.1.60
- Twenty fortress decks, from the crash site to the salvage bay
- Keycards, doors, labelled ammo / health / guns, shootable LOOT boxes, side caches, and off-path health booths
- Blaster, plasma spray, pulse laser, beam, and plasma lance, plus dash, breach, and a hull patch
- Progress (unlocks, guns, best score) saved locally

## Run

```bash
python3 -m http.server 18846 --bind 127.0.0.1
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:18846/`.

## Play

- WASD move, 1–5 switch guns, Shift dash, F breach, Space fire, shoot LOOT boxes, P pause
- Score is kills only — no shop currency. Shoot yellow LOOT boxes for ammo, health, guns, and gear
- Doors open red, then green, then blue
- Clear the fortress core, then hold E at the wreck to patch the hull

## Tests

```bash
./test.sh
```
